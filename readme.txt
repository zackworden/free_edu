PURPOSE

The ideal, possibly impossible purpose of this project is to provide a free education resource for anyone willing to learn.

The hope is that this project provides the infrastructure for a crowdsourced, freely available collection of education 'courses', allowing anyone,
for free, to access materials and learn. The general guideline is "How much should a functioning member of society know about [insert topic here]".
There are countless sources for in-depth information available, but this project aims to provide a means for people to become acquainted with a 
topic, to a level that allows them to be well-versed enough to think critically about that topic.
